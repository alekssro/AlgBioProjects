# You should implement an algorithm for computing the RF distance between two unrooted evolutionary trees over the same set of species. The algorithm can e.g. be Day's algorithm as explained in class. You should make a program called rfdist which as input takes two evolutionary trees in Newick format (also referred to as 'New Hampshire format'), and outputs the RF distance between them.
